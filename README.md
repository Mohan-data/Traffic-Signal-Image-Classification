## Methodology

- Dataset: Utilized a large dataset of traffic sign images for training and evaluation.
- Model Training: Employed optimization techniques for model parameters and hyperparameters.
- Neural Network Architectures: Explored different architectures to assess their capabilities in traffic sign recognition.
## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Neural Network Architectures (e.g., InceptionV3, CNN)


## Project Pipeline

- Data Collection: Gathered a comprehensive dataset of traffic sign images.
- Data Preprocessing: Implemented preprocessing techniques to standardize and normalize the images.
- Model Development: Developed and trained various neural network models.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of each model using accuracy metrics.
